# ChoiceReferenceAttribute
This package allows you to use the [ChoiceReference] attribute to make a popup interaction to select a subclass from which the base class that you specified as the field type inherits. Lists and arrays are also supported, as is the fact that this attribute will be used again in subclasses.
